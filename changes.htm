    We said in our conceptual design that we would include a blog.
    
    Although we were able to create a new page, using the .css to match the style/theme 
    of the home page - we decided it was too much work/out of the scope of the project 
    to include the blog when we already created the additional "buy" page. We were able to
    get as far as creating a blog page, incorporating clickable blog preview elements - but
    again, decided it was beyond the scope of the project to create mutiple pages/blogs
    in accordance with advice given from Prof.Hildrich.
